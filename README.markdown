# CheckCSS

This is just a slightly modified and gemified fork of [courtenay/css_file_sanitize](http://github.com/courtenay/css_file_sanitize), which uses a blacklist to check for suspect css. Unfortunately, this is a weak way to approach the problem. Long story short, *don't rely on this in production.*
